export const homeWelcomeText = `Music-Books is an application designed to match the mood of music to the content of text. It can serve both as a tool for finding the ideal musical backdrop while reading a book, and for discovering new songs based on selected phrases. This makes it possible to choose music that perfectly fits the entered text fragment – whether it's an emotion description to enrich the current moment, or words that will help better experience difficult moments.
The application will also work well in more personal situations – for example, when choosing music for a favorite fragment of a family film from a few years ago, which we want to present to loved ones in a new light. Music-Books opens up a space for the user to create unique connections between text and music.`;

export const textMatcherText = `The search engine allows you to find music tracks that match the given text fragment. The operation is very simple – just enter the text you are interested in and click the "Search For Music" button. Then you must wait for a while, as the search process may take several minutes. After it is complete, the most suitable musical suggestions will appear on the right side. By clicking the "Open in Spotify" button, you will receive a ready-made playlist with the most highly matched songs, which will be played directly in Spotify.`;

export const bookMatcherText = `The search engine allows you to find music tracks that match the given fragment of a book. The application will automatically match new tracks with subsequent pages, but the first match may take a while.`;
